            What Is a Bean Pie?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into what makes Shaba's Bean Pies stand out, let's
            first talk about the star of the show: the bean pie. Originating in
            African American communities, particularly in the South, bean pies
            are a delicious blend of sweet and savory ingredients, with the key
            ingredient being navy beans. When combined with a mixture of spices,
            sugar, and a buttery crust, the result is a rich and flavorful
            dessert that can be enjoyed at any time of day.
          </p>
          <p>
            While bean pies have a long history and are tied to soul food
            culture, Shaba's Bean Pies has taken this traditional treat to the
            next level with a recipe that has won the hearts and taste buds of
            many. The pies are made with love and care, using only the freshest
            ingredients to create a dessert that tastes like it came straight
            from Grandma’s kitchen.
          </p>
